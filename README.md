## What is D3.js

D3 stands for Data Driver Documents. It's a JavaScript library which is used to make a dynamic, interactive and graphical view of digital data. It can be used to analyse data, present data or even for forecasting it. It's best practice to use SVGs since PNGs and JPGs lose their image quality when being resized.

> SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Rather than displaying an image, it describes how the image should appear. That's why it doesn't lose its quality when it's resized.

## Why does this repository exist

I've created this repository to keep track of my progress on Adam Janes React.js his online-course. Each commit represents a video of his course.

## Host local http server

To see the creation of your models, you have to run a http server. This can be easily done with Python3.

Instructions:

1) Download Python3 from the original site.
2) Run your systems CLI in your project folder.
3) Enter the next line to host your http server.

```python
# Run this in the main CLI of your OS.
python -m http.server

# Little note: it uses port 8000.
```

> Download [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to quickly run a localhost http server.
